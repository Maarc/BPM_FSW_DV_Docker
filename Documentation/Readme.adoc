== What it's all about
This demo has been build to demostration a combination of various Red Hat JBoss products, aimed to have something to demo them and to get an idea on how to achieve an integration.

The scenario covered is the request for a household insurance and is build upon the following services.

image::./Images/System_Overview.png[]

== Prerequisites

=== Salesforce.com Demo Account
In this demo we will use JBoss Data Virtualization to

	1. access data from a Postgres database
	2. access data from a Salesforce.com account
	3. join these two to one virtual database

The installer for this demo will take care of the creation of the Postgres database, but in order to work with Salesforce.com you will need your companies account for Salesforce.com or a free-of-charge demo account.


To register for a demo account please do follow the https://www.salesforce.com/form/signup/freetrial-sales.jsp[instructions] from Salesforce. +
As we will be using Salesforce.com via their API, you need to also register for a https://success.salesforce.com/answers?id=90630000000glADAAY[security token].

Details on how to create the correct datarecords will be covered at a later step in this manual.

=== Dockerhost
The entire demo is build on https://www.docker.com/[Docker]. The various elements, like JBoss BPM Suite, JBoss Fuse, Postgres and JBoss Data Virtualization all run in their own container.

image::./Images/Overview.png[]

Shows an overview on how these Docker images are build on each other. We will cover the details in the relevant sections later in this manual.

Please do follow the instructions on how to install Docker on your host, based on the https://docs.docker.com/installation/[relevant pages] from Docker.com

=== Maven, Ant & JDK
As our installation procedure will build a few jars for you convenience, please do have the appropriate tools up and running on your Docker host.

== Building the Demo Environment

=== Getting the code

The procedure to build the various requried Docker container has been automated for your convenience, all you need to do is to clone the most current version of the demo from github
----
git clone https://github.com/PatrickSteiner/BPM_FSW_DV_Docker.git
----

=== Customizing the code
JBoss Data Virtualization needs to know your Salesforce.com login and password to be able to retrieve data. To add your credetials to this environment, please open `./HEISE_DV_Image/config/standalone.xml` in your editor of choice and search for the section
----
<resource-adapter id="Salesforce_DS">
	<module id="org.jboss.teiid.resource-adapter.salesforce" slot="main"/>
	<transaction-support>NoTransaction</transaction-support>
	<connection-definitions>
		<connection-definition class-name="org.teiid.resource.adapter.salesforce.SalesForceManagedConnectionFactory" enabled="true" jndi-name="java:/Salesforce_DS" pool-name="Salesforce_DS">
			<config-property name="password">
				[your password+security-token]
            </config-property>
			<config-property name="username">
				[your login]
            </config-property>
		</connection-definition>
	</connection-definitions>
</resource-adapter>
----
Replace `[your password+security-token]` and `[your login]` with your personal data.

=== Providing the Red Hat JBoss Products
I have not included the various JBoss products in the git repository, so it will be your obligation to retrieve them and to place them in their directories.

	* `jboss-eap-6.1.1.zip` into `./EAP_Image`
	* `jboss-bpms-6.0.3.GA-redhat-1-deployable-eap6.x.zip` into `./BPM_Image`
	* `jboss-fsw-installer-6.0.0.GA-redhat-4.jar` into `./FSW_Image`
	* `jboss-dv-installer-6.0.0.GA-redhat-4.jar`into `DV_Image/software`
	* `jbdevstudio-product-universal-7.1.1.GA-v20140314-2145-B688.jar` into `DV_JBDS_Image/software`
	* `jbdevstudio-product-universal-7.1.1.GA-v20140314-2145-B688.jar` into `BPM_JBDS_Image/software`


=== Building the Docker container

After changing into the `BPM_FSW_DV_Docker` directory, all you need to do is run the provided script, take a cup of coffee ( make it a big one ) and start
----
./demo.sh build all
----

Once the script has finished, you can verify with `docker images` the status of the created container. You should have at least the following entries in your local image repository

----

== Starting the environment

Once you have completed the previous step, you can run the demo in your own environment. Simply use `./demo.sh start all` to start all images with the required parameter and configurations.

When completed, the script will have started container for JBoss BPM Suite, JBoss Fuse Service Works, JBoss Data Virtualization and a Postgress.

If you want to verify the start, you can do so with `docker ps`. It should show something like

----

== What's in the box
Overall this demo is about a fictional request for a new household insurance. As in reality this process is not a single step, but consists of various tasks which need to be done in a certain order. In our case

 1. request the data for the object that needs insurance
 2. calculate a insurance policy, based on a few rules
 3. ask applicant to accept the calculated policy
 4. check if this applicant is already known to us
 5. ask for his address if he is unknown
 6. document everthing for later dashboarding ( Business Activity Monitoring )

To implement these tasks, the demo makes use of various products and feature of the JBoss product family.

=== Process Management
The steps described above are orchestrated via the process management capabilities of JBoss BPM Suite.

image::./Images/process_model.png[]

=== Rules Management
The steps __Calculate tariff__ and __Calculate max/min__ in above process model, are implemented via the Rules Management part of the JBoss BPM Suite. With the aid of rules management, it is possible to

 * break many complex rules into small pieces
 * make the rules readable and manageable for business people

image::./Images/rules.png[]

=== Data Virtualization
As in many real business, our demo lacks a central point of information for customer data - well, ok - in the case of the demo, this was intentional ...

In our case we have two distinct datasources, a Postgress Database and a table from Salesforce.com, which we access via the remote.

For simplicity reasons, the Postgres database only consists of two fields which hold the name of a customer and one for the rather complex Salesforce-ID.

image::./Images/postgres_db.png[]

Salesforce has a very large dataset for contacts, which we do make use of.

image::./Images/salesforce_db.png[]

JBoss Data Virtualization does join these two datasources, which are based on different technologies and different server and presents it to the business process as one __virtual database__

image::./Images/vdb.png[]

=== Business Activity Monitoring
For many users of process management systems, it is of high importance to be able to see what has happened. In our case this would be monitoring things like

 * how many contracts have been signed
 * how much money did we earny
 * which contracts sold how good/bad
 * ...

== How it's been done

The is demo environment does give you more then a runnable environment for the products, but also a development environment. This can be used to either take a look on how I have done the demo or to extend it.

For your education, the next sections of this document will give a brief introduction on how I have done the various parts. It is not a replacement for the product demo!!

=== JBoss Data Virtualization
To get to the JDV development environment, please make sure to have stop all running containers before you start the development tooling. This can be done with
----
./demo.sh stop all
----
once this completed, you may want to use
----
> docker ps
> docker ps -a
----
to verify all container have successfully been stopped.

Now you are ready to start the JBoss Data Virtualization development environment with
----
./demo.sh start dv_jbds
----

Please do select `/tmp/workspace` as the home directory for your workspace if you want to see how I have done it, or any other directory if you want to start from scratch.

==== Setting up the development environment from scratch
If you decided to re-create the virtual database, please apply the following steps to your environment.

After having started the JBoss Developer Studio via
----
./demo.sh start dv_jbds
----
please select a new directory for your workspace.

image::./Images/2014-12-09_09-30-38.png[]

WARNING: Be aware that files in the container will be lost after stopping the image. If you want to keep them for later steps, please run `./demo.sh commit dv_jbds` from your Docker host system.

Once JBoss Developer Studio has started, please select the `Software/Update` page of the `Welcome to JBoss` page. There you can select and install the additional JBoss Integration Stacks. Please do select at least the `JBoss Data Virtualization Development` capabilities.

Click the `Install` button to proceed.

image::./Images/2014-12-09_09-38-40.png[]

On the following dialog-screens please leave everything as it is and just click the `Next >` buttons.

image::./Images/2014-12-09_09-40-54.png[]

image::./Images/2014-12-09_09-41-17.png[]

Accept the license agreement and start the install process by selecting `Finish`.

image::./Images/2014-12-09_09-41-44.png[]

Lean back, and enjoy the show ...

image::./Images/2014-12-09_09-42-53.png[]

Select `OK` in the dialog warning about unsigned content.

image::./Images/2014-12-09_10-03-46.png[]

Restart JBoss Developer Studio to apply the changes.

image::./Images/2014-12-09_10-06-40.png[]

Change to the `Teiid Designer` Eclipse Perspective.

image::./Images/2014-12-09_10-07-31.png[]

In the `Model Explorer` Eclipse View, click on the highlighted link to define a default Teiid Instance.

image::./Images/2014-12-09_10-09-27.png[]

Select `JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1+` as the server profile and proceed by selecting `Next >`

image::./Images/2014-12-09_10-09-52.png[]

Select the directory hosting the JBoss Data Virtualization server and click on `Finish`.

image::./Images/2014-12-09_10-10-24.png[]

Eclise wants you to select a Secure Master Password, here you can enter whatever your heart desires.

image::./Images/2014-12-09_10-11-01.png[]

The new Master Password could be recovered by adding another password. Here you can proceed to your liking.

image::./Images/2014-12-09_10-11-23.png[]

Now that we have configured the location of the JBoss Data Virtualization server location, the `Servers` Tab of Eclipse shows the new `JBoss EAP 6.1+ Runtime Server`. Please start this server.

image::./Images/2014-12-09_10-11-40.png[]

After the server has started, please double-click an the `JBoss EAP 6.1+ Runtime Server` link in the `Servers` Tab.

image::./Images/2014-12-09_10-11-44.png[]

Go to the `Teiid Instance` view of the servers configuration and  enter the credentials for the `JDBC Connection`.

image::./Images/2014-12-09_10-13-41.png[]

Select `Test JDBC Connection` to verify that you haven't introduced a typo.

image::./Images/2014-12-09_10-15-47.png[]

You are done with configuring and installing the JBoss Data Virtualization Tooling.

WARNING: If you want to persist the installation them for later steps, please run `./demo.sh commit dv_jbds` from your Docker host system.

==== Starting a new project
Assuming, that you decided to start from scratch, please create a new `Teiid Model Project`

image::./Images/2014-12-06_19-19-17.png[]

We will call this new project `Customer`.

image::./Images/2014-12-06_19-20-16.png[]

After selecting `Next` on the following screen, you will be presented with a dialog to create subdirectories in your project folder. To be able to follow this documentation, please name your folder as follows and select `Finish`

image::./Images/2014-12-06_19-21-25.png[]

Please make sure, that your JBoss Data Virtualization server is up and running.

image::./Images/2014-12-06_19-21-56.png[]

==== Importing Postgres Data
As the first step, we want to import the data from our Postgres database and store it as the source modell for later stages. For this you should select the `Datasource` folder and click on `Import` from the context menu.

image::./Images/2014-12-06_20-06-24.png[]

From the dialog, please select JDBC as the source for our model.

image::./Images/2014-12-06_20-06-41.png[]

We will create a new _Connection Profile_

image::./Images/2014-12-06_20-07-08.png[]

From the list of possible profile types, select _PostgreSQL_ and name this new connection _Postgres_Driver_ and proceed to the next screen with `Next >`

image::./Images/2014-12-06_20-07-38.png[]

In this stage, we need to enter the database specific connection parameter. Please do take them from the following screenshot.

image::./Images/2014-12-06_20-08-27.png[]

To verify you didn't introduce any typos, please do `Test Connection`.

Click `Finish` when the test ran successful.

image::./Images/2014-12-06_20-10-24.png[]

Select `Next >` to retrieve the meta data from the Postgres server.

image::./Images/2014-12-06_20-11-05.png[]

In the following screen, leave everything as it is and click on `Next >`

image::./Images/2014-12-06_20-11-23.png[]
From all the various information identified by the importer, please select the _customer_ database table and select `Next >`

image::./Images/2014-12-06_20-11-49.png[]

Please make sure, that the model will be stored in the correct folder and complete this step by selecting `Finish`

image::./Images/2014-12-06_20-12-26.png[]

The newly imported table structure should be presented to you!
